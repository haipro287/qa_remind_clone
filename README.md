# Selenium Java Scripts for Remind Clone Client

## Setup

### For Linux

Install maven

```sh
sudo apt install maven
```

Install project dependencies

```sh
mvn install
```

### For Windows

As for the folk using Windows, I am sorry. Please try to run the project on your own :3 Or just switch to Linux.

## Run the test

I am using VSCode to write this script. There is a little button above each test class to run the test. Press it.

I rarely if ever use Maven in my life so I don't understand how to start the test using the command line. :<
